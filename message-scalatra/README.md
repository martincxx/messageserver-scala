Download and extract project (message-scalatra directory) then open a Terminal (Linux) on its directory and execute sbt.
```sbt```
Once server started then execute:
```sbt:Message Scalatra> jetty:start```
(Please do not pay attention to eventual warnings, wait for plugins download and activation, server works fine)
